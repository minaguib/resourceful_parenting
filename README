ResourcefulParenting
====================

A rails plugin that makes working with nested resources easier.

It provides the following methods to your RESTful controllers:

 * parent : Returns the most immediate parent resource
   * parent(-1)       : Same as parent
   * parent(-2)       : Returns the parent resource's parent
   * parent(N)        : Returns the Nth parent resource
   * parent(0)        : Returns the top level parent
 * parents            : Returns an array of all the parent resources
 * polymorphic_p_url  : Same as calling polymorphic_url but adding parents to the list
 * polymorphic_p_path : Same as calling polymorphic_path but adding parents to the list

polymotphic_p_url and polymorphic_p_path are automatically exposed as helper methods for usage in the views.  Feel free to expose the others via helper_method in your ApplicationController


Installation
============

Add to your Gemfile:

  gem 'resourceful_parenting'


Example
=======

Assuming the classical problem of a comments resource nested under several different parent resources:

  class CommentsController < ApplicationController

    def create
      # regular create work, then:

      redirect_to parent # Back to the parent's show page
      # OR
      redirect_to polymorphic_p_url(@comment) # Back to /parents/ID/comments/ID
      # OR
      redirect_to polymorphic_p_url(:comments) # Back to /parents/ID/comments

    end

  end


Todo
====

A respectable test suite.   This plugin was just a bunch of ApplicationController methods I decided to extract.


Notes
=====

There is similar functionality in other plugins, however they often do lots more which I didn't need.

This plugin was inspired after watching Ryan Bates hand-roll a custom method for doing this for the Nth time.
